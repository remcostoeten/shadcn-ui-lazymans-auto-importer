**./add-component.sh toast**

âœ” Component toast already exists. Would you like to overwrite? â€¦ yes
âœ” Done.

Imports updated in src/components/ui/ui-imports.tsx.

cat src/components/ui/ui-imports.tsx

Instead of cloning or manually copying, run this in your root.

# Download update-imports.js

Why you ask? I hate a ðŸ’©-load of imports, and always forget the npx shad command.

## far from perfect, far from done, but thats life. It works, somewhat.

This allows you to type in the root `./add-component.sh *component*` which can be any shadcn. Which then downloads the component to either `components/ui` or `src/components/ui`. Besides that it creates a `ui-imports.tsx` which handles all the imports and exports which means you can go from having a component like such:
```js
import { Toast} from "@/components/ui/toast"
import { johndeezel } from "@/components/ui/johndeezel"
import { button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { input } from "@/components/ui/input"

export default function SoDirty() {
}
```
To
```js
import { toast, johndeezel, button, input } from "ui-imports"

export default function SoClean() {
}
```

## Getting started

Either clone this repo or copy the `update-import.js` and `add-components.sh` to your root dir. Feel free to rename add-components to whatever you feel like. Cool people do something like `echo "alias addshad='./add-components.sh'" | cat - ~/.zshrc > temp && mv temp ~/.zshrc ; && source ~/.zshrc` which allows to type `addshad *COMPONENTNAME*` only. `.sh` might require you to run `chmod +x ./add-components.sh`.

Das it.
